an lmomkoatomic  ideal  gas,intially  at  a  temperature  endclosed  in a  cylinderical  filter  witha  frictsionless  piston   the gas  is  allowed  automaticalluy  to  a temperature  
by  releasing  the  piston  suddenly  if and  length  of  a  gas  colroumn  before  and  after expansion  respectively  than  is  given  by 
three  samples  of same  gas  x,y,z,  for  which  the  ratio  of specific  gas   havae intially  the same volume the  volumes of  each  sample  is  doubled  by  adiabatic  process  in  th e 
case and  by  isothermal  process in the  case of  y and z  aif  the  intial  process of  the  x,y,z  are  in  the  ratio  than the  ratio  of  final  pressure  
a   moles  of an  ideal  gas process im  which the  temperature  changes  with  a  volume as  the  work  done by  the  gas  as  the  temperature  from
cal  of  heat is  requried to rise  the  temperature of  an  ideal  gas  at  constant  temperature  and  pressure  what  is the  amount  of  heat  requried  to  raise  
t he  temperature  of  same  gas  through  thr  same range at  constant  volume 
the  relation  between  intetnal  energy  pressure  and  volume of  a gas  in  an  adiabatic  process  is where a  and  b  are  constants what  is the  value  of  ratio  specific  heats
two  carnot  engine  a and  b  are  operated  in  sucession.  the  first one a receives  heat from  a  source  at  and  rejects  to  a  sink  at  . The  second  engine B recives  to  a
sink  at  .if  the  effidciendcy  of  two  engine  are  equal  than  the  value  of is 
a given  mass of  a  gas  expands  from  the  state  a  to  state b  by  the  three  parts.respectively  by  the  work  done by  the  gas  along  the  three parts  than 
a closed  vessel contains some  gas  at a given  temperature  and  pressure .if  the  vessel is given  a very   high velocity  ,than  the  tempera ture  of a gas

one mole  of diatomic gas  undergoes a  cyclic  process  as  shown  in the  figure . the process  is  adiabatic  .
a  diatomic  ideal  gas is used  ina car  engine  as  the  working  subustances  . volume of gas  increases fresom  during  the  adiabatic   expansion  part of  cycle  
the  efficiency  of   the  engine  is.;;;
